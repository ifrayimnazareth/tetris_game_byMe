# tetris_game_byMe
This is a Tetris game project that I created using only three front-end languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, this game project is still in the development or prototype stage. There are still many elements and features that I need to add so that this web-based game can run on all platforms, namely PC and Android.
